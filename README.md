# Keeping the branch updated
1. When your branch has been merged, switch to the main branch and run : git pull origin development.
2. The above command will pull the updated code into your main repo and then you can create another branch.
3. It is preferred to perform Step 1 before making a PR so that you can incorporate the updated changes in your active branch(i.e the feature branch).
